# Company Building Enhancements

A simple quality of life mod to speed up the task of selling your items to the Company.

A config file will be created automatically after you boot the game for the first time with the mod installed, allowing you to enable/disable specific features to your liking.

**Features:**

-   ### **Instant Landing At Company Building *(enabled by default)***

    When landing at the Company Building, the ship now lands instantly. You will be able to run to the shelf to sell your items as soon as the ship doors open.</br> </br>
    **This setting will automatically sync with the host's config file to avoid any desync issues.**

-   ### **Automatic Landing At Company Building When Deadline Reaches 0 Days *(disabled by default)***

    When the deadline reaches 0 days, the ship now automatically re-routes & lands at the Company Building. This feature is disabled by default as I want to keep the default config file as vanilla as possible. If your goal is to reduce time at the Company as much as possible, this setting is quite nice to have on.</br> </br>
    **This setting will automatically sync with the host's config file to avoid any desync issues.**

-   ### **Sell Scrap From Terminal *(enabled by default)***

    When the ship is landed at the Company Building, you can now use commands from the terminal to sell your scrap items to the Company. </br> </br>
    Typing "sell scrap" will get you started. It will display a few things on screen: </br> </br>
        - The current company buying rate</br>
        - The amount of scrap items you have in your ship and their combined value at the current company buying rate.</br>
        - The best combination of scrap items you have in your ship required to meet quota and their combined value at the current company buying rate.</br>
        - Two options to sell your scrap items: 'sell' & 'sell all'</br>
        - Typing 'sell' will sell the best combination of scrap items required to meet the quota.</br>
        - Typing 'sell all' will sell all of the scrap on your ship.</br>
        - If you don't care about any of the information on the 'sell scrap' screen, you are welcome to type 'sell' or 'sell all' to skip the info/confirmation window.</br>
        - **Gift Boxes will be ignored in case you forget to open them.**</br>
        - **Any item that is currently held in any player's inventory will be ignored.**</br>
        - Like any other feature in this mod you can enable/disable it from the config file, but it is enabled by default as you can simply ignore the terminal commands if you would like.</br> </br>
    **This setting will automatically sync with the host's config file.**

-   ### **Infinite Stamina/Sprint At Company Building *(enabled by default)***:

    When landing at the Company Building, you will have infinite stamina/sprint.

-   ### **Weightless Inventory At Company Building *(disabled by default)***:

    When landing at the Company Building, you will have a weightless inventory. This feature is disabled by default as it has the potential to function improperly depending on your modlist. A list of known incompatibilities can be found below. If you experience any incompatibilities that aren't already listed, please disable the feature and let me know in the Discord!

# Known Compatibility Issues

-   ### **Advanced Company**
    - "Instant Landing" feature will not function

-   ### **BetterStamina**

# Extra Info

- **ALL PLAYERS IN THE LOBBY MUST HAVE THE MOD INSTALLED**  
- Settings that affect ship behavior (Instant/Auto Landing) will sync with the host's config file to avoid any desync issues (as long as other players have the mod installed). Your personal/local config file will remain unaffected. The other features (Infinite Sprint/Weightless Inventory) are set per player based on their personal config file.
