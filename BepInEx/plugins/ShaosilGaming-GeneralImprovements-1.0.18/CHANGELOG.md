	<ul>
		<li>Fixing total value at end of round not calculating correctly.</li>
		<li>Fixing items falling to the ship floor when loading a save. In other words, things should stay on shelves, tables, etc.</li>
		<li>Finally fixed compatibility with ReservedItemSlot mods by detecting whether it is loaded and adjusting certain things.</li>
		<li>Fixed compatibility with AdvancedCompany by basically disabling any behavior that shifts item slots around if that mod is loaded.</li>
	</ul>
	&nbsp;
	<li><b>v1.0.9</b> - More fixes and improvements</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Modified the snap rotation to allow for free rotation when holding ALT (also supports counter clockwise when combined with SHIFT)</li>
		<li>Fixed compatibility with the <a href="https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Electric131/IsThisTheWayICame/">IsThisTheWayICame</a> mod by rotating the player instead of the fire entrance coords.</li>
		<li>Adding a config setting to have the map screen always face straight up (instead of angled a bit). This defaults to OFF.</li>

	&nbsp;
	<li><b>v1.0.8</b> - v47 support and snap rotation</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Fixing things that broke in Lethal Company version 47. MAY NOT BE BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE.</li>
		<li>Minor fix to "Starting Money Per Player" to prevent exploits.</li>
		<li>Added a way to snap rotate to (n) degrees when using ship build modes. (n) is configurable (must be an interval of 15 and go evenly into 360). Setting it to 0 uses vanilla rotation.</li>
	</ul>
	&nbsp;
	<li><b>v1.0.7</b> - More fixes and improvements</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Fixing clients not registering server ship scrap as in the ship when connecting (which would make the terminal scan inaccurate for them).</li>
		<li>Changing the hover tip for inverse teleporters to "Beam out" (instead of "Beam Up" like the regular one) for clarity.</li>
		<li>Adding a "Money per player" config option for hosts, defaulting to 30, that adjusts the group credits before the game starts as players connect and drop. Setting to -1 reverts to vanilla behavior.</li>
		<li>Changed the clipboard starting position to be hanging on the wall, so it's easier to see initially and not in the way of the teleport button.</li>
		<li>Fixed certain shadows from two-handed objects (especially the bottles) not having transparency when the auto LAN/ONLINE config option was set (that was fun to track down).</li>
		<li>Fixed the issue where dropping items would cause certain items (weapons, etc) would not be held correctly or animated.</li>
	</ul>

	<li><b>v1.0.5</b> - Hotfix!</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Reverting the fix from 1.0.4 for compatibility with ReservedItemSlot mods, since it completely broke HotBarPlus and similar mods. Sorry ReservedItemSlot users! Your best bet is to set <b>RearrangeOnDrop</b> to false.</li>
		<li>Fixing the left arrow key not cycling back around properly when viewing radars from the terminal.</li>
		<li>Fixing the monitor to display the correct player name on radar when first starting a round.</li>
